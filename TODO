    just filename; sometimes it doesn't show up, though (too dark): a way
    to specify negative color?
  notate artifact with model and date metadata (possibly just filename?)
* TODO does the annotation rob a color from the image
  if there is no pure black around? test it.
* TODO coreutils >= 8
  turns out we might need a configure script after all, since the
  `mktemp --suffix' option was only introduced in coreutils 8.
