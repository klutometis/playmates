These scripts make my grub splash screen much more interesting by
sampling a random Hefnerian artifact at 640x480; but it can be used on
an arbitrary directory of jpg-artifacts.

The idea is that, after the artifact directory (see
playmate-splash.sh) has been populated (see playmates.sh),
$(PREFIX)/bin/playmate-splash will be run by sysinit; thus presenting
a unique splash upon the next boot.
