These scripts make my grub splash screen much more interesting by
sampling a random Hefnerian artifact at 640x480; but it can be used on
an arbitrary directory of jpg-artifacts:

  1. populate an artifact directory (see playmates.sh);
  2. configure playmate-splash.sh accordingly;
  3. run `make install';
  4. configure sysinit to run playmate-splash on startup (via
     e.g. rc.local).

Voil√†: a new and titillating splash screen every startup!

You might set your menu.lst (grub.conf) to contain something like
this:

  timeout=10
  splashimage=(hd0,1)/grub/splash.xpm.gz

according to your local setup, of course.
